page for more details or see the map's <a href="//en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki_talk:Oblivion_Map_Design">Talk Page</a> to discuss or ask
questions about this map.

<ul>
<li><b>Zooming</b> -- Using the mouse's scroll wheel or the +/- buttons in the upper right. <br/> &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Panning</b> -- Click and drag the mouse around or use the arrow keys in the upper right. Currently you cannot drag on
	top of an "area" element in the map.<br/> &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Changing Maps</b> -- Click on a "door" or other icon/text on the map to jump to that map location. 
	Use the right mouse button to return the parent map. You can also manually select a map to view  from the map list at 
	the top	of the screen.<br/> &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Wiki Article</b> -- Use the <em>Goto Wiki Page</em> at the top of the map to view the wiki article for the
	current map. Click on any regular location to display a popup window (note that this will teleport you to another
	map for door locations). Click the title text at the top of the popup window to jump to the relevant wiki article if 
	available. <br/> &nbsp;</li>	
<li><b>Searching</b> -- Use the text field in the upper left of the map to find a particular location. Click on a result to
	jump to that location. You can search for location names, types, and some quests and achievements as well.
	<br/> &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Perma-Linking</b> -- Use the <em>"Link"</em> button at the top of the map to create a unique link that duplicates
	the current map, location, and zoom level.<br/> &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Editing</b> -- Certain users of the UESP Wiki are able to add/edit/delete locations. Simply login to the wiki in the
	same browser in another tab and reload the map. Edit buttons should appear at the top of the map if you are permitted
	to edit.<br/> &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
