
			UESP Game Map
			by Dave Humphrey (dave@uesp.net)
			================================
			
The GameMap is a very simple alternative to Google maps for the purpose of
displaying game maps. It was specifically designed for showing Elder Scrolls
maps on the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (www.uesp.net) but it can be 
easily used for other game maps on other sites if desired.

Note that currently the GameMap project is under very early development.

Source code is released under the GPL v2.
