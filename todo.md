## last week

ads and starfield map customisation

- fix hang related to resizing map
- edit ui hides when resizing to mobile-sized screen
- added ads to rest of the maps (starf included)
- added mobile ad layout
- dehardcoded border radius from padding (made starf have square ui)
>> ui elements such as the loading box transition between radius and custom colours smoothly
- dehardcoded fonts, each map family can have its own logo font now
- dehardcoded wiki links, so the logo and menu items (help, feedback) can be properly set on starfield now

ads and starfield map stuff is done, just need to push to master and config repos
